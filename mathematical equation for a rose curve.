The code for generating a rose pattern is based on a polar coordinate system and the mathematical equation for a rose curve. The specific equation used is:

𝑟
=
sin
⁡
(
𝑛
𝜃
)
r=sin(nθ)
Here's a detailed breakdown of the mathematics behind it:

Polar Coordinates:
Polar coordinates describe points in terms of their distance (r) from the origin and an angle (θ or theta) from a fixed direction (typically the positive x-axis).
In our case, r is the radial distance, and θ is the angle that varies between 0 and 
2
𝜋
2π (one full revolution).
Rose Curve Equation:
The rose curve is a well-known mathematical function in polar coordinates, defined as:

𝑟
=
sin
⁡
(
𝑛
𝜃
)
r=sin(nθ)
Where:

r is the radial distance (how far the point is from the center).
θ is the angle in radians (it ranges from 0 to 
2
𝜋
2π to complete one full rotation).
n is an integer that controls the number of petals.
Effect of n on the Rose Shape:
If n is an integer:
Odd n: The rose will have n petals. For example, if n = 3, the rose will have 3 petals.
Even n: The rose will have 2n petals. For example, if n = 4, the rose will have 8 petals.
In our code, n = 5, so the plot will show 5 petals.
Working of the Equation:
As θ increases from 0 to 
2
𝜋
2π, the value of sin(n \theta) oscillates between -1 and 1. This periodic behavior of the sine function creates a symmetrical, petal-like structure.
When sin(n \theta) is positive, r is positive, and the plot extends outward from the origin.
When sin(n \theta) is negative, r becomes negative, which means the point is plotted in the opposite direction (but effectively traced in the same outward direction due to the nature of polar coordinates).
Visualization of the Rose Curve:
The rose curve forms petals by creating alternating lobes for positive and negative values of sin(n θ). The resulting pattern repeats itself n or 2n times, depending on whether n is odd or even.

When n = 5 (odd): The curve forms 5 petals.
When n = 4 (even): The curve forms 8 petals (double the value of n).
Code Breakdown:
theta = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 1000): This generates 1000 evenly spaced values of θ between 0 and 
2
𝜋
2π (360 degrees). This range ensures the rose is fully traced.

r = np.sin(n * theta): This calculates the radial distance r for each value of θ, following the rose curve equation.

ax.plot(theta, r, color='red', lw=2): This plots the rose curve in a polar coordinate system, using red color for the petals.

Summary:
The mathematical equation 
𝑟
=
sin
⁡
(
𝑛
𝜃
)
r=sin(nθ) describes a rose curve in polar coordinates, where n controls the number of petals. The code uses this equation to generate a rose-like plot with a specified number of petals based on the value of n.
