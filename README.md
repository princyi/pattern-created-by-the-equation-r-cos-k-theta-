The pattern created by the equation r = cos(k * theta)

The pattern created by the equation r = cos(k * theta) doesn't resemble a typical flower-shaped  but rather a mathematical curve, which can appear abstract.

Explanation:
The polar equation r = sin(n * theta) is used to create the shape of a rose.
The value of n controls the number of petals. For this example, n = 5, which gives a 5-petaled rose.
You can change the value of n to see different numbers of petals.
If you increase n, you'll see more petals. This version creates a more familiar rose shape with sinusoidal petal curves.
