The pattern created by the equation r = cos(k * theta)

The pattern created by the equation r = cos(k * theta) doesn't resemble a typical flower-shaped  but rather a mathematical curve, which can appear abstract.

Explanation:
The polar equation r = sin(n * theta) is used to create the shape of a rose.
The value of n controls the number of petals. For this example, n = 5, which gives a 5-petaled rose.
You can change the value of n to see different numbers of petals.
If you increase n, you'll see more petals. This version creates a more familiar rose shape with sinusoidal petal curves.

import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Set up the figure
plt.figure(figsize=(6,6))

Define the theta values (angle)
theta = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 1000)

Define the rose curve with the equation r = sin(n * theta)
n = 5 # Controls the number of petals r = np.sin(n * theta)

Create the polar plot
ax = plt.subplot(111, projection='polar')

Plot the rose curve
ax.plot(theta, r, color='red', lw=2)

Add gridlines for better visuals
ax.grid(True)

Show the plot
plt.show() explain this code line by also the mathematical equation also


I'd be happy to explain this code and the underlying mathematical equation.

Code Explanation

This code is used to generate a polar plot of a rose curve using the NumPy and Matplotlib libraries in Python.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

The first two lines import the necessary libraries: NumPy (np) for numerical computations and Matplotlib (plt) for plotting.
plt.figure(figsize=(6,6)) sets up a figure with a size of 6 inches by 6 inches.
theta = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 1000) generates an array of 1000 evenly spaced values from 0 to 2π (inclusive), which will be used as the angle values for the polar plot.
n = 5 sets the number of petals for the rose curve. This value controls the frequency of the curve.
r = np.sin(n * theta) calculates the radius values for the rose curve using the equation r = sin(n * theta), which is the mathematical equation for a rose curve.
ax = plt.subplot(111, projection='polar') creates a polar subplot with a single axis.
ax.plot(theta, r, color='red', lw=2) plots the rose curve using the theta and r values, with a red color and a line width of 2.
ax.grid(True) adds gridlines to the plot for better visualization.
plt.show() displays the final plot.
Mathematical Equation

The mathematical equation for a rose curve is:

r = sin(n * θ)

where:

r is the radius (distance from the origin)
n is a positive integer that controls the number of petals
θ is the angle (in radians)
This equation generates a curve with n petals, where each petal is a sinusoidal curve. The frequency of the curve increases with the value of n.

In this specific code, n = 5, which means the rose curve will have 5 petals. The theta values range from 0 to 2π, which covers one complete cycle of the curve.

I hope this explanation helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
