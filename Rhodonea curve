The equation 
𝑟
=
cos
⁡
(
𝑘
𝜃
)
r=cos(kθ) is known as a rose curve or sometimes referred to as a rhodonea curve. This is a type of mathematical curve plotted in polar coordinates. It is a special case of a sinusoidal curve in polar form, and it generates petal-like shapes that resemble a rose.

Breakdown of the Equation:
𝑟
r is the radial distance (how far the point is from the origin).
𝜃
θ (theta) is the angle in radians in polar coordinates.
𝑘
k is a constant that determines the number of petals.
Characteristics of the Rose Curve 
𝑟
=
cos
⁡
(
𝑘
𝜃
)
r=cos(kθ):
When 
𝑘
k is an integer:
If 
𝑘
k is odd, the rose will have 
𝑘
k petals.
If 
𝑘
k is even, the rose will have 
2
𝑘
2k petals.
The equation also has a symmetric counterpart 
𝑟
=
sin
⁡
(
𝑘
𝜃
)
r=sin(kθ), which generates a similar pattern, just rotated.
Example of Petal Count:
𝑟
=
cos
⁡
(
3
𝜃
)
r=cos(3θ): This gives a rose with 3 petals.
𝑟
=
cos
⁡
(
4
𝜃
)
r=cos(4θ): This gives a rose with 8 petals.
The number of petals can be easily predicted based on whether 
𝑘
k is even or odd:

Odd 
𝑘
k: The number of petals will be exactly 
𝑘
k.
Even 
𝑘
k: The number of petals will be 
2
𝑘
2k.
Why is it called a Rose Curve?
This curve is called a "rose" because of its appearance. The repeated lobes resemble the petals of a flower, and the curve itself is a type of sinusoidal spiral. It's a common example used in mathematics to demonstrate symmetry and periodicity in polar coordinate systems.

Visualization Example:
For 
𝑟
=
cos
⁡
(
5
𝜃
)
r=cos(5θ), the resulting curve will have 5 petals. For 
𝑟
=
cos
⁡
(
6
𝜃
)
r=cos(6θ), the curve will have 12 petals.

General Form:
The general form of a rose curve equation is:

𝑟
=
cos
⁡
(
𝑘
𝜃
)
or
𝑟
=
sin
⁡
(
𝑘
𝜃
)
r=cos(kθ)orr=sin(kθ)
Both forms create the petal-like structures, but they differ slightly in orientation.
